### Overview
Arduino is the most used hardware by the students. Starting from projects to prototyping, most use Arduino Uno. It is very easy to learn and very simple to get started. In this beginner workshop, you'll be learning the basics of Arduino & building an Arduino circuit that will be able to play the **Coffin Dance** song.

Previously we had conducted a series on Arduino, so if you don't know about Arduino then go through the series and get some idea.
